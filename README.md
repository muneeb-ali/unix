This repository contains a collection of scripts and how-tos that I've found useful over the years.

* howtos -> howtos on system admin (mostly debian) and github
* scripts -> some everyday scripts and shortcuts to make life from the command-line easier
* dockerfiles -> docker build files for common servers
