Run the namecoind docker as:

> docker run -p 8332:8332/tcp muneeb/namecoind

The docker has the following settings for namecoind:

```
rpcuser=default
rpcpassword=default
rpcport=8332
rpcallowip=*
```

And doesn't have SSL on. It is meant to be run on a localhost. See 

## Installing Docker on OS X:

If you want to run this on OS X, you can install docker by:

```
brew install docker
brew install boot2docker
boot2docker init
boot2docker up
docker run -d -p 80:80/tcp digitalpassport/resolver
```

Docker on OS X has a time sync issue that affects namecoind. Run:

> /usr/local/bin/boot2docker ssh sudo ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org

To manually sync the clock before running the docker. Also, on OS X the docker is running inside virtualbox which means you will not be able to talk to the resolver on http://localhost. Instead:

> boot2docker ip

Will give you the IP address of the VM e.g., 192.168.59.103 and you can then that as the server address.
